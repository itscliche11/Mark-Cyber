<h2>📊Experience</h2>

Security Analyst. 02/2023 - Present

Performed the following tasks for Azure Sentinel (SIEM):

- Used custom Powershell script to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer to be forwarded to third party API in order to derive geolocation data

- Configured Log Analytics Workspace in Azure to ingest custom logs containing geographic information (latitude, longitude, province, country)

- Configured custom fields in Log Analytics Workspace with the intent of mapping geo data in Azure Sentinel

- Configured Azure Sentinel (Microsoft’s cloud SIEM) workbook to display global attack data (RDP brute force) on world map according to physical location and magnitude of attacks.

Performed the following task for creating Active Directory lab:
- Created a virtual machine to act as a domain controller to house active directory and inside it I've configured network adapters that connect to the VMware network and the public internet. 

- Setup a DHCP on a domain controller to lease IP addresses to simulated clients that I've created through a powershell script

- Created a domain through Active Direct Domain Services

- Configured routing and NAT so  clients in the private network can reach the internet from the domain controller.

- Created and ran a powershell script that creates new users and gives them usernames and passwords, an organisational unit and an employee ID. I've essentially used the powershell script to replicate a corporate network onboarding process.

Performed the following tasks for conducting vulnerability scans with Nessus

- installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts

- Implemented Vulnerability management function on sandbox networks: Discover, Prioritise, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify

- Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities

- Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with Vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updated and third party software.

Performed the following tasks for Coding a File Integrity Monitor using Powershell and Hashing Algorithms

- Created a Baseline that was used to monitor any changes within a Target File by comparing the Hashes stored within the baseline to the Target File Hash

- Loaded the baseline.txt hash files into a dictionary

- Created a iteration loop function that calculates Hash Values from Target Files then compare the file hash to what is stored in the baseline.txt file

- Used Powershell to Store the file hash pairs into a baseline.txt file

- Created a Powershell script that monitors files with a saved baseline and load 

- Wrote a Cmdlet that displays messages to the console alerting the user if contents of a file or the file itself  has been changed or deleted.


<h2>🧠SKILLS</h2>

- Self-starter: Once starting out in a new work environment, I do not heavily rely on staff to excel at my position. I will take the initiative to define and make plans to execute my goals to not only help myself thrive in my position but also help my new team to achieve our objectives. If there is a knowledge gap I do not expect senior staff to strain themselves for my sake, I will instantly research and gather information about the needs of my new team and make an effort to meet above the expectation by providing proactive solutions. 

- Team Work + Communication Skills: In my current role, I am tasked to communicate in MDT meetings with Doctors, Consultants, Psychologists, Nurses or my IT support team and a range of other specialists on coming up with plans about how to  deliver the best possible care to patients. This enables me to consider viewpoints from different perspectives of medical specialists and create solutions that help meet ward unit objectives.

- Interpersonal Skills: I have attained significant experience in building and maintaining positive relationships with colleagues, managers, psychologists, consultants, nurses and service users. This evolved from me being approachable, empathetic and being able to collaborate effectively with others.  I am able to adapt my language depending on the audience I am speaking to. For example, I can either use more sophisticated language whilst collaborating with a nurse or break down my language when having any discussions with a different employee. Also able to liaise with my IT support team about mitigation methods and ticketing enquiries as I am able to take on the initiative to funnel growth across an organization or team. 

- Ethical Mindset: As an employee under West London NHS Trust, I do have access to patients' protected information and because of this I am enforced and able to follow ethical standards such as the GDPR. I am also able to consider the impact of security decisions on individuals and organizations as well as ensure privacy of data. In relations to my extensive study in cybersecurity I am also able to follow compliance standards such as HIPPA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, ISO 27002 and the NIST Framework



- Customer Service: I possess a strong ability to actively listen about people’s concerns, asking clarifying questions to pinpoint the exact issue they are experiencing. This ensures that I can gather accurate information for effective troubleshooting. I also understand how frustrating technical issues can be for people but I am able to demonstrate patience whilst delivering clear guidance throughout the interaction and keep all parties involved with the progress of the issue being resolved. As well as this, I am able to offer positive reinforcement during the resolution process. This helps builds a more collaborative problem-solving environment between myself and a customer.
  By combining these skills related to customer service, I ensure a smooth and positive experience for users encountering technical issues. This allows me to not only resolve problems efficiently but also build rapport with customers whilst promoting a positive image for my workplace.
