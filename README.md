<h2>📊Experience</h2>

Security Analyst. 01/2024 - Present

Performed the following tasks for Azure Sentinel (SIEM):

- Used custom Powershell script to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer to be forwarded to third party API in order to derive geolocation data

- Configured Log Analytics Workspace in Azure to ingest custom logs containing geographic information (latitude, longitude, province, country)

- Configured custom fields in Log Analytics Workspace with the intent of mapping geo data in Azure Sentinel

- Configured Azure Sentinel (Microsoft’s cloud SIEM) workbook to display global attack data (RDP brute force) on world map according to physical location and magnitude of attacks.

Performed the following task for creating Active Directory lab:
- Created a virtual machine to act as a domain controller to house active directory and inside it I've configured network adapters that connect to the VMware network and the public internet. 

- Setup a DHCP on a domain controller to lease IP addresses to simulated clients that I've created through a powershell script

- Created a domain through Active Direct Domain Services

- Configured routing and NAT so  clients in the private network can reach the internet from the domain controller.

- Created and ran a powershell script that creates new users and gives them usernames and passwords, an organisational unit and an employee ID. I've essentially used the powershell script to replicate a corporate network onboarding process.

Performed the following tasks for conducting vulnerability scans with Nessus

- installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts

- Implemented Vulnerability management function on sandbox networks: Discover, Prioritise, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify

- Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities

- Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with Vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updated and third party software.
